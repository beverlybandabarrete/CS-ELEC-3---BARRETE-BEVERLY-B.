# Activity 1 â€“ Pillow Digital Medal

## Concept and Theme
For this activity, I created a **gold medal design** using Python and the Pillow library.  
The theme is **Intramurals Champion 2025**, awarded to the **College of Computing and Information Sciences**.  

## Tools Used
- Python 3.13
- Pillow (PIL) library

## Features
- Gradient background (navy to black / white version also tested).
- Golden glow behind the medal for emphasis.
- Blue ribbon and gold medal with star design.
- Centered award text with shadow for readability.
- Decorative border around the design.

## Learning
This activity helped me understand how to:
- Use Pillow to draw shapes (ellipse, polygon, rectangles).
- Add text with fonts, colors, and shadow effects.
- Apply gradient backgrounds and glow effects.
- Save outputs as image files for submission.

I learned how programming and creativity can be combined to make digital artwork.
